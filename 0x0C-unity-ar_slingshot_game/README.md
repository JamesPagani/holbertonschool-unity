# 0x0C. Unity - AR Slingshot Game

## About this project
In the last project I used Vuforia, which is another AR engine, to create a business card. This time, the goal is to create a simple "slingshot" game where the goal is to knock down all targtes. Where said targets appear depends on the flat surface the user chooses.

### WARNING
In order to test the builds, your phone must either be compatible with ARCore (for Android devices) or ARKit (for iOS devices). Otherwise, the app might not run well (or it won't run at all).
