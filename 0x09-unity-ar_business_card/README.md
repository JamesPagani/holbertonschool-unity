# 0x09. Unity - AR Business Card

## About the project
This project marks my first experimentation with Augmented Reality. As the name of the folder implies, the objective is to create an interactable AR business card with (at least) 4 contact links. This objective was acomplished by using Vuforia, an AR engine that can either be integrated with an existing C++ or Unity project.
