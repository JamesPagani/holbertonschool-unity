# 0x07. Unity - Animation

## About
This is a continuation of 0x06. Unity - Assets: UI.

In this project, built on top of the previously mentioned one, we added an intro animation for each level, as well as replacing the placeholder character with a model with animations.

## IMPORTANT

Due to the requirements of a task, the controls have been reworked:
- While standing still, the moving the camera won't rotate the character.
  - The player will still follow the camera while moving.
- The player will rotate depending on the direction it's moving.
- Jumping has been adjusted, no longer detecting input in FixedUpdate().
