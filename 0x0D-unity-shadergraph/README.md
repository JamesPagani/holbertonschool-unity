<h1 align="center">0x0D. Unity - ShaderGraph</h1>

## About this project
Rather than create a game or XR experience, this project focuses on *shaders*.

After reading the basics of how a computer renders objects (2D or 3D) into the screen, I proceeded to create some effects in Unity using their No-Code tool called *ShaderGraph*.

### The shaders you'll find
- Glow
- Glow animated
- Disintegrate
- Ice
- Hologram
- Water

## Some Technical info
- Developed on Unity **2020.3**.
    - This project *uses **and requires*** the *Universal Render Pipeline (URP)*, though it should work with the *High-Definition Render Pipeline*.
